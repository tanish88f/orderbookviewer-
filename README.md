# Real-Time Order Book Viewer with Monte Carlo Simulations

Welcome to the Real-Time Order Book Viewer, a dynamic and interactive application designed to provide real-time bid and ask prices fetched from a server. This project showcases the power of WebSockets in creating a live, data-rich, and responsive user interface. 

One of the key features of this application is the implementation of Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations are used to predict the future behavior of the order book, providing valuable insights and aiding in decision-making processes.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Data**: Leveraging the power of WebSockets, our application provides real-time updates of bid and ask prices.
2. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Our application uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict future behavior of the order book, providing valuable insights.
3. **Interactive UI**: The data is presented in an easy-to-understand table format, color-coded for bids and asks.
4. **Robust Backend**: The backend, written in Python, efficiently fetches and processes data from the server.
